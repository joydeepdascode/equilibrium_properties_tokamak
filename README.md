# Equiibrium Properties Tokamak

In the above two python codes, the equilibrium properties generation and grid generation equilibrium magnetic flux lines are done. Although for security reasons, they are named as T1, T2 and the properties of the two tokamaks and the corresponding input files are not present.

Going through the code one can generate the following
* The nature magnetic field looks like in Bx,By,Bz direction
* The Equilibrium magnetic flux field lines
* The limiter region along with the separatrix.
* Generation of grid points along the Magnetic Filed lines.

Running the above python codes will save the generated files with their respective type.
